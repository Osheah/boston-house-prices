GMIT Data Analytics Machine Learning and Statistics: Assessment 2019 

**Due the 29th of November 2019**




# Programming for Data Analysis Assignment 2019 - Investigate the Boston House Price Dataset



## Requirments of the assignment

This assesment concerns the well-known Boston House Prices dataset and the python packages scipy, keras and jupyter. The requirments of the assignment are as follows
1. Describe: 
  1. Create a git repository and make it available for the lecturer to clone
  2. The repository should contain all the work for the assignment. 
  3. Create a jupyter notebook that uses descriptive statistics adn plots to describe the dataset
2. Infer: 
  1. In the jupyter notebook, add a section where inferential statistics are used to analyse whether there is a significant difference   in the median house prices between houses that are along the Charles river and those that aren't. You should explain and discuss your findings within the notebook. 
3. Predict:
  1. Use Keras to create a neural network that can predict the median house price based on the other variables in the dataset. You can use all the variables or a subset. 

### Other requirments 

   1. Use github version control in public repo
   2. Upload repo url to the assignment section on student page. 
   3. Commit history of at least 10 with a decent body of work in each commit
   4. Meaningful commit messages
   5. Assignment deadline **29/11/2019** at midnight
   6. README file containing an explanation of what is in the repository and how to run jupyter notebook and a summary of your work. 
   7. Jupyter notebook with the project
         * Explain the dataset
         * Have well conceived, interesting and well researched project
         * Assignment covers jupyter notebook so include fancy stuff like images, links, code and plots
         * Any python package that you fancy. 
         * written in markdown
   8. gitignore file



## Getting Started

First get the required software, as I have windows 10 on my pc I'm only adding links to this version of various software. 

### Prerequisites

This project requires

   * Jupyter notebook
   * Python via Anaconda and other python packages like numpy, pandas, keras, matplotlib, sklearn.... add more
   * cmder 
   * Github account
    
Anaconda has python, ipython, jupyter notebook and a large number of common python packages required in Data Analysis. 

   1. Get anaconda 3.7 version for windows [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
   2. Get git 2.19.1 [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
   3. Get cmder 1.3.6 [Cmder](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/download/v1.3.6/cmder.zip) - Optional (cmder comes with git so you can drop option 2 above if you go with option 3).  
   4. Get github account - set up github account and create a repo [Github](https://github.com/)


### Installing

Install the above packages. Any problems google it. Update any packages; From cmder type... 

```
conda update â€“all 
git - version

```

## Repository structure

The gitignore file ignores the .git and .ipynb_checkpoints in the local folder. Python files are also ignored. A standard gitignore file was used. It can be found here [Python gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore) 


* .gitignore - gitignore file taken from [gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore)
* License - GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3
* README.md - this readme
* project.pdf - a pdf of the assignment
* research - a folder containing pdf's 
* img - images as I cant get firefox to link to external images 
* data - the dataset
* **boston-house-prices.ipynb** - The main body of the assignment


## Jupyter 

The main body of work is in the jupyter notebook ***boston-house-prices.ipynb***. 


### Running a Jupyter notebook


#### Start jupyter notebook

There are two ways to start jupyter notebook. 

   1. Via the Anaconda App 
   2. Via the command line on cmder. 

I will describe the cmder approach.


Open cmder in your home directory or from a folder within the home directory. Jupyter notebook will only be able to access this folder and any sub folders. For example ...
```
C:\Users\Username\Desktop\WorkFolder\github\
```

   * Create a repo on github [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Osheah/boston-house-prices)
   * Clone the repo on github by clicking the green clone or download link
    
Go to cmder and enter ... for example

```
git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git

```
Open jupyter notebook using the command...

```
jupyter notebook

```
A browser should open linking the current directory in cmder to an jupyter version of windows explorer. Jupyter notebook will open at its home page http://localhost:8888/tree


### create a jupyter notebook

Navigate to your cloned folder from within the Jupyter notebook home. On the right click the 'new' button and select python 3. A new jupyter notebook for python 3 will open with the default title *untitled*. Click on the name *untitled* and rename it e.g. projectnaem.ipynb. Details on how to create cells in jupyter notebook can be found here [Jupyter Notebook Documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#basic-workflow). Save any work (although it is usually saved automatically). 

### ending a jupyter notebook session

Save any unsaved jupyter notebooks. Close jupyter notebook windows in your browser. Go to cmder and enter **control + c** i.e the control key and c key pressed at the same time. This shuts the ipython kernal that jupyter uses. Upload your notebook to github via the commands below; Make sure that you are in the directory that git is initialised in e.g. C:\Users\Username\Desktop\Workfolder\projectfolder\ for example...

```
git status
git add .
git commit -m "add a relevant commit message"
git push
```

### opening a jupyter notebook

Jupyter notebooks have the extension ipynb. When you find a notebook that you want to look at or edit, don't click on it; Instead right click and save it to your local pc. Then open jupyter notebook via the cmder commandline and navigate to the notebook. NB; **before opening the notebook make sure the notebook is saved in a sub directory of the cmder path**. Jupyter notebooks cannot access any files that are not within the path when the kernal is called.
